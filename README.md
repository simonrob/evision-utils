# e:Vision Utilities
A userscript to improve e:Vision usability:

- Display all students, meetings and "letters" at once, rather than separating into pages
- Allow sorting tables by date order (or any other column)
- Highlight students more clearly by status and supervisory relationship
- Allow hiding specific tutees and unnecessary interface elements
- Add an option to automatically fill in the more tedious parts of the engagement form
- Turn extenuating circumstances select boxes into buttons to speed up getting to the list itself
- Unhide the home and back buttons to avoid having to log in repeatedly
- Skip the empty homepage and go straight to the research management tab
