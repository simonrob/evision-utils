# e:Vision Utilities
A userscript to improve e:Vision usability:

- Display all students, meetings and "letters", rather than separating into pages
- Allow sorting tables by date order
- Unhide the Home button to avoid having to log in repeatedly

Use via, e.g., [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
